    Chickens are domestic or farm birds. The live span of a chicken is about 10 to 15 years. The male is larger and more brightly colored than the female. This is common feature in birds. The males show off their colorful feathers to attract the females. A chicken has a comb on the head and two wattles under the neck.

    Vegetables form a healthy diet which keeps our stomach full for a longer time. As a result, one doesnâ€™t gain weight even if he overeats vegetables every day. Vegetables that are healthy and easy to be added in daily food are tomatoes, garlic, broccoli, carrot, spinach and so on. Vegetables are said to be the best food for our body.

    Fish (plural: fish or fishes) are an aquatic group of vertebrates which live in water and respire (get oxygen) with gills. They lack limbs with digits (fingers & toes). This is a definition which does not quite work: some amphibia also live in water and have external gills, but they are not fishes. Fish used to be a class of vertebrates.
